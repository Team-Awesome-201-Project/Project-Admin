# Team Guidelines and Rules

## Cooperation Plan
<!-- Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

Describe at least: -->

**What are the key strengths of each person on the team?**
  
  - Amy: Debugging, organized
  
  - Matteus: persistence, researching, adaptive
  
  - David L: Organizing, researching
  
  - David T: Time constraints, creative, design

**How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?**

  - Communication and coordination of our strongest skillsets. Not taking on a task that we know is too difficult for our personal skill levels. Speaking up when theres a roadblock of your personal assignment. 

**In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?**

  - Amy: Interruption, pre-work/prep
  
  - Matteus: Code confidence, organizing
  
  - David L: Productivity, code confidence
  
  - David T: Project importance/time management

**Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?**
<!-- NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here. -->

  - Knowing the expectations of the teams and project as a whole. Communication as a whole needs to be top notch. Focusing on your task at hand, not diverting off the path. Daily meetings and meetings before leaving the classroom. 

<br>

## Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

<!-- Describe at least: -->

**What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**

  - Address the problem immediately with the whole group. Be upfront, the longer something waits the worst it becomes.

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**

  - Don't talk about fight club
  - If someone is not contributing, immediate meeting and discussion. No assuming its intentional, things happens.

**How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**

  - You're only as fast as your slowest runner, if done early reach out to help the other members. Don't move onto the next step of the project ahead of the others, everyone moves to the next level together.


**How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**
**How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**

  - Immediately when a team-member feels like the products timeline is severely compromised.

<br>

## Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

<!-- Describe at least: -->

**What hours will you be available to communicate?**

9am - 9pm

**What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?**

  - Slack, phone, etc.

**How often will you take breaks?**

  - Redbull and more Redbull. What is a break?
  - Every hour, 10-15min breaks.

**What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**

  - Reach out and help your fellow devs, one fails we all fail

**How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?**

  - Respectfully and limited

**What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?**

  - WRITE IN ALL CAPS!
  - Don't talk over each other, everyone needs to be heard if they have something to say


**How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?**

  - Tell someone how you feel the same way you would want them to reach out to you if the roles were reversed

<br>

## Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

<!-- NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks. -->

<!-- Describe at least: -->

**How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?**

  - Deciding who will be doing what, having members announce when they complete their tasks

**What project management tool will be used?**

  - Trello

<br>

## Presentation Deck
Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.

Link to the shared doc in your project plan.

Schedule your practice session
Work with your instructor to pre-schedule a date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”

<br>

## Git Process
Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

<!-- Describe at least: -->

**What components of your project will live on GitHub?**
 
 - Everyones branches and notes working towards the project.

**How will you share the repository with your teammates?**
  
  - We are all working in an organization in GitHub

**What is your Git flow?**
 
 - Everyone has their own branch to work off of

**Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:**

  - Yes we will!

**How many people must review a PR?**

  - Reviewed by at least 2 people that have not worked on that pull request

**Who merges PRs?**

  - Anybody can merge into main, must be a full group vote.

**How often will you merge?**

  - Minimum twice a day into MVP, main will stay untouched until we reach milestones

**How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?**

  - During our daily meetings, morning and afternoon
